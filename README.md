## Description

60 Easy is a cross-platform health habit-tracking app built with React Native and designed to make building healthy routines simple, sustainable, and achievable. Inspired by the "75 Hard" challenge but tailored for realistic, science-backed progress, 60 Easy helps users establish daily habits that foster mental clarity, physical health, and emotional well-beingâ€”without overwhelming demands.

## Key Features

* **Daily Hydration Tracker**: Log daily water intake to encourage consistent hydration.
* **Workout Goals**: Track daily workouts, with flexibility for once- or twice-daily exercise sessions.
* **Evening Wind-Down Options**: Choose from relaxing evening activities like reading, stretching, or walking, reinforcing a calming end to the day.
* **Dietary Goals**: Set and track achievable dietary goals with specificity, providing more guidance than traditional habit challenges.
* **Accountability Tools**: Track progress with features for uploading photos, recording weight, and even sharing milestones on social media.

## Goals and Approach

60 Easy uses principles from behavioral psychology to make habit-building manageable and motivating. By focusing on daily streaks, visual progress, and accountability, it encourages users to build routines that positively impact their lives.

## Built With

* **React Native**: For a seamless experience on both mobile and web, allowing users to access 60 Easy on desktop, iOS, and Android.
* **Firebase** *(coming soon)*: For user authentication and data storage, allowing users to securely save and access their progress.
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Additional core technologies for the web experience, ensuring responsive and engaging front-end design.
